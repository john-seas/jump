# Jump: John's Universal Macro Preprocessor

 This script is a universal preprocessor for Python code blocks in markdown files. 
 It allows for the execution of Python code snippets embedded within a text document, 
 capturing their output, and replacing the original code blocks with the output.

## Usage

#### **Command:** `python3 jump.py [-options] <filename> [<output_filename>]`

### Options:
* `-l <py_line_ending>`: Optional line ending for Python code blocks, default is empty string.
* `-p <PARAM_PATH>`: Optional path to a file containing parameters.
* `-v` : Optional verbose output.

## Writing a .jump file:
Embedding Python is pretty easy. Simply enclose it between ` ```py ` and ` ``` ` blocks.
Anything you print() gets rendered in the output file.
You can also pass a parameter file path with the `-p` option.

## Example: 

#### **Input:** `mytxt.jump`
    This is normal text file contents and will render exactly as written.
    ```py
    print("This text is generated by Python! Below is the parameter path passed in:")
    print(PARAM_PATH)
    ```
    This is normal text file contents again.
#### **Command:** `python3 jump.py -p myparams.json mytxt.jump mytext.txt`
#### **Output:** `mytxt.txt`t
    This is normal text file contents and will render exactly as written.
    
    This text is generated by Python! Below is the parameter path passed in:
    myparams.json
    
    This is normal text file contents again.
